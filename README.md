Frontierline
============

A WordPress theme for Mozilla blogs, inspired by Array Themes' Baseline.

Uses Sass as a CSS preprocessor. Source files are in the `/sass` folder and
should be compiled to `style.css` in the theme's root folder. To make style
edits, modify the source files and recompile `sass --style compact
--sourcemap=auto ./sass/style.scss style.css`.
**Don't edit `style.css` directly!**

* WP Version: 4.0+
